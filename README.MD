## About The Project

As a avid follower of the professional League of Legends scene, I have always
been very interested in the ban/pick phase (or the draft phase) of the game.
There are many tools out there that can assist you with it, but I want to make
my own tools that I can tweak to my own interests. Thus, this project was born.

This project was created with:

- React.js v18.2.0
- Express.js v4.18.2
- MongoDB Atlas

It is hosted at
